# DepMap Analysis

DepMap Analysis is a project that aims at providing an automated framework 
for explaining high-throughput scientific data.

## Source of crispr data

We use the CRISPr data from the Dependency Map 
[portal](https://depmap.org/portal/) managed by the Broad Institute.

## Indra DepMap Service

The INDRA DepMap Service is a web service that exposes the (pre-)assembled 
knowledge in INDRA for network path searches. Currently the service can only be run locally. See the 
[documentation](link-to-ipython-notebook-instructions) for instructions on how to run the service 
locally.  

## Funding

DepMap Analysis is funded as part of the DARPA Automated Scientific Discovery 
Framework (ASDF), grant number W911NF018-1-0124.
